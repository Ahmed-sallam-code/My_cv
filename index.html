                <h3>Maths and Physics</h3>
                <p class="skill-dis">I love mathematics and physics to the moon. The fun that a person has dealing with math and physics problems is 
                    immeasurable. I am quite gifted in both of them and I like the way that they encounter some topics in a ways that are 
                    so beautiful and amazing.

                <h3>Drawing</h3>
                <p class="skill2-dis">In the last couble of mounths, I have been tring to improve my drawing skills and I got some good results 
                    so far, So I'm considering this as a skill. know I'm trying to impersonate the human feelings into my 
                    drawings. This relifs me and makes me so happy.</p>

                <h3>Problem solving</h3>
                <p class="skill-dis">Last year, I've begun my learning of problem solving. I love how it's challenging and requires a diffrent way
                    of thinking to encounter problems and how to find a way to compute a program that does a specific task. unluckly 
                    I couldn't participate in ECPC this year, But I'm determined to participate next year. So I'll keep going.

                <h3>Photoshop</h3>
                <p class="skill2-dis">Thankfully, I know the basics of photoshop as I used it while working with 
                    Madao studio to make anime adaptations from japanese mangas.Although my tasks were simple, I would 
                    finish my assignments on time. I used to sepereate manga parts(charchters and objects) so that animators 
                    could start animating the episode.

                <h3>Premiere</h3>
                <p class="skill-dis">I'm also quite familier with adobe premiere, as I used it to edit tons of videos for my 
                    youtube channel "Egyptian man". It was quite a ride, but to focus on my study I abandoned my youtube channel 
                    and using premiere with it. I'm sure if i get back to it, I'll return my level in such a short time. 
                    but for now, Let's learn some web design.
